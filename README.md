## Problem 1: Array Max Result

#### Problem Statement
Given an array select a number that exists, and output the computated "score". The method you create should take in
both an array of integers and the integer the user selected.

Create a Console application that requests 5 numbers between 1-10. Output the array to the console and Ask the user to
select a number. After the selection, output the "score" of the number chosen.

#### Selection and Scoring Algorithm
You can select any number from the list, however your scoring will be depend on the frequency of that number in the list. 
E.g for [2,2,3,5,4] if you pick 2 your score will be 4 (2 * 2) but if you pick 5 your score will be 5 (5 * 1)

#### Input Format
An array of integers, and the number chosen.

#### Sample Input
[6,4,4,1,3] , 4

#### Sample Output
8

## Problem 2: Leap Year Calculator

#### Problem Statement
Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

```
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

Note: This is not a trick problem. Edge cases do not need to be taken into consideration when creating a solution.
